Get the Score of the final ensemble
===================================
After training the estimator, we can now quantify the goodness of fit. One possibility for
is the `R2 score <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#r2-score>`_.
The values range between -inf and 1 with 1 being the best possible value. A dummy estimator
predicting the data mean has an R2 score of 0.

Plot the predictions
====================
Furthermore, we can now visually inspect the predictions. We plot the true value against the
predictions and show results on train and test data. Points on the diagonal depict perfect
predictions. Points below the diagonal were overestimated by the model (predicted value is higher
than the true value), points above the diagonal were underestimated (predicted value is lower than
the true value).
