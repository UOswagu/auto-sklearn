=================
Model Explanation
=================

The following example shows how to fit a simple classification model with
*auto-sklearn* and use the `inspect module <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/inspection.html>`_ from
scikit-learn to understand what affects the predictions.

Load Data and Build a Model
===========================

We start by loading the "Run or walk" dataset from OpenML and train an auto-sklearn model on it.
For this dataset, the goal is to predict whether a person is running or walking based on
accelerometer and gyroscope data collected by a phone. For more information see
`here <https://www.openml.org/d/40922>`_.

Compute permutation importance - part 1
=======================================

Since auto-sklearn implements the scikit-learn interface, it can be used with the scikit-learn's
inspection module. So, now we first look at the `permutation importance
<https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/feature-importance.html>`_, which defines the
decrease in a model score when a given feature is randomly permuted. So, the higher the score,
the more does the model's predictions depend on this feature.

**Note:** There are some pitfalls in interpreting these numbers, which can be found
in the `scikit-learn docs <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/permutation_importance.html>`_.

Create partial dependence (PD) and individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots - part 2
==========================================================================================

`ICE plots <https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/ice.html>`_ describe the relation
between feature values and the response value for each sample
individually -- it shows how the response value changes if the value of one feature is changed.

`PD plots <https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/pdp.html>`_ describe the relation
between feature values and the response value, i.e. the expected
response value wrt. one or multiple input features. Since we use a classification dataset, this
corresponds to the predicted class probability.

Since ``acceleration_y`` and ``acceleration_z`` turned out to have the largest impact on the response
value according to the permutation dependence, we'll first look at them and generate a plot
combining ICE (thin lines) and PD (thick line)

Create partial dependence (PDP) plots for more than one feature - part 3

A PD plot can also be generated for two features and thus allow to inspect the interaction between
these features. Again, we'll look at acceleration_y and acceleration_z.
