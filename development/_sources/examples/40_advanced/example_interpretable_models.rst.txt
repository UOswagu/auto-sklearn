====================
Interpretable models
====================

The following example shows how to inspect the models which *auto-sklearn*
optimizes over and how to restrict them to an interpretable subset.

Show available classification models
====================================

We will first list all classifiers Auto-sklearn chooses from. A similar
call is available for preprocessors (see below) and regression (not shown)
as well.

Build and fit a classifier
==========================

We will now only use a subset of the given classifiers and preprocessors.
Furthermore, we will restrict the ensemble size to ``1`` to only use the
single best model in the end. However, we would like to note that the
choice of which models is deemed interpretable is very much up to the user
and can change from use case to use case.
