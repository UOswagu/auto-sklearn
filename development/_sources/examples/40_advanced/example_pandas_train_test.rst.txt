==========================
Performance-over-time plot
==========================
This example shows, how to use the *performance_over_time_* attribute to plot the performance
over train time.  *performance_over_time_* can contain multiple metrics within a pandas dataframe, namely:

    - ensemble_optimization_score
    - ensemble_test_score
    - single_best_optimization_score
    - single_best_test_score
    - single_best_train_score

*auto-sklearn* can automatically encode categorical columns using a label/ordinal encoder.
This example highlights how to properly set the dtype in a DataFrame for this to happen,
and showcase how to input also testing data to autosklearn.

The X_train/y_train arguments to the fit function will be used to fit the scikit-learn model,
whereas the X_test/y_test will be used to evaluate how good this scikit-learn model generalizes
to unseen data (i.e. data not in X_train/y_train). Using test data is a good mechanism to measure
if the trained model suffers from overfit, and more details can be found on `evaluating estimator
performance <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation>`_.

In order to provide *\*_test_score* metrics, X_test and y_test must be provided to the AutoML-Model, as 
shown in this example.

There is also support to manually indicate the feature types (whether a column is categorical
or numerical) via the argument feat_types from fit(). This is important when working with
list or numpy arrays as there is no per-column dtype (further details in the example
:ref:`sphx_glr_examples_40_advanced_example_feature_types.py`).
