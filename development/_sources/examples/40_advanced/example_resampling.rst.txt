=====================
Resampling Strategies
=====================

In *auto-sklearn* it is possible to use different resampling strategies
by specifying the arguments ``resampling_strategy`` and
``resampling_strategy_arguments``. The following example shows common
settings for the ``AutoSklearnClassifier``.

Perform a refit
===============
During fit(), models are fit on individual cross-validation folds. To use
all available data, we call refit() which trains all models in the
final ensemble on the whole dataset.

scikit-learn splitter objects
=============================
It is also possible to use
`scikit-learn's splitter classes <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#splitter
-classes>`_ to further customize the outputs. In case one needs to have 100% control over the
splitting, it is possible to use
`scikit-learn's PredefinedSplit <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/
sklearn.model_selection.PredefinedSplit.html>`_.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 98-101

Below is an example of using a predefined split. We split the training
data by the first feature. In practice, one would use a splitting according
to the use case at hand.

For custom resampling strategies (i.e. resampling strategies that are not
defined as strings by Auto-sklearn) it is necessary to perform a refit:

Obviously, this score is pretty bad as we "destroyed" the dataset by
splitting it on the first feature.
