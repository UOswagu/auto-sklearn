==========================
Fit a single configuration
==========================

*Auto-sklearn* searches for the best combination of machine learning algorithms
and their hyper-parameter configuration for a given task, using Scikit-Learn Pipelines.
To further improve performance, this pipelines are ensemble together using Ensemble
Selection from Caruana (2004).


This example shows how one can fit one of this pipelines, both, with an user defined
configuration, and a randomly sampled one form the configuration space.

The pipelines that Auto-Sklearn fits are compatible with Scikit-Learn API. You can
get further documentation about Scikit-Learn models here: <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html`>_
